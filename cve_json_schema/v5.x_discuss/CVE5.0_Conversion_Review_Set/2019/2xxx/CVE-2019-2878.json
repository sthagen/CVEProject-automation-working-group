The supported version that is affected is 8.8.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Sun ZFS Storage Appliance Kit (AK). Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Sun ZFS Storage Appliance Kit (AK), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Sun ZFS Storage Appliance Kit (AK) accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Sun ZFS Storage Appliance Kit (AK) accessible data.
