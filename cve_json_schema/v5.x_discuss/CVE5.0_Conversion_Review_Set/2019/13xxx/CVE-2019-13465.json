ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array, and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the communication-related functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm."
