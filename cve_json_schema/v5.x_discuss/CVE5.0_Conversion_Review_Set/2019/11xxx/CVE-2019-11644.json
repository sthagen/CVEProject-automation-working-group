The installer writes the file rm.exe to C:\\Windows\\Temp and then executes it. The rm.exe process then attempts to load several DLLs from its current directory. Non-admin users are able to write to this folder, so an attacker can create a malicious C:\\Windows\\Temp\\OLEACC.dll file. When an admin runs the installer, rm.exe will execute the attacker's DLL in an elevated security context."
