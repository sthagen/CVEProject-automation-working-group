The vulnerability is due to an error in TCP-based packet inspection, which could cause the TCP packet to have an invalid Layer 2 (L2)-formatted header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP packet sequence to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition."
