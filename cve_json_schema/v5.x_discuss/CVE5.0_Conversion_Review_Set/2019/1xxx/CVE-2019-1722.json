The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software version X12.5.1 and later."
