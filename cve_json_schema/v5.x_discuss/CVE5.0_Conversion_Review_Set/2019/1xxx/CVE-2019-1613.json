The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected running software versions prior to 6.2(27) and 8.2(3). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(6). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected running software versions prior to 6.0(2)A8(11) and 7.0(3)I7(6). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5).
