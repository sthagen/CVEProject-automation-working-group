The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying various CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system."
