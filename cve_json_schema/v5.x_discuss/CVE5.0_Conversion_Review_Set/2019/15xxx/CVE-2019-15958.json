The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the initial High Availability (HA) configuration and registration process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file during the HA registration period. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited during the HA registration period. See the Details section for more information."
