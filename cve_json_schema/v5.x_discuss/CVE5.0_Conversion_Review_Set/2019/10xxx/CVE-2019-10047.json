An authenticated attacker can upload an HTML file containing JavaScript code and afterwards a file preview URL can be used to access the uploaded file. If a malicious user shares an uploaded HTML file containing JavaScript code with another user of the application, and tricks an authenticated victim into accessing a URL that results in the HTML code being interpreted by the web browser, then the included JavaScript code is executed under the context of the victim user session."
