An attacker with network access to the device could cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending a specially crafted UDP packet. The vulnerability affects the UDP communication of the device. The security vulnerability could be exploited without authentication. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises availability of the targeted system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
