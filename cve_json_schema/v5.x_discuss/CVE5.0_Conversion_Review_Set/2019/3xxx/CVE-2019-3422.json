Through the analysis of related product team, the information disclosure vulnerability is confirmed. The MF910S product's one-click upgrade tool can obtain the Telnet remote login password in the reverse way. If Telnet is opened, the attacker can remotely log in to the device through the cracked password, resulting in information leakage. The MF910S was end of service on October 23, 2019, ZTE recommends users to choose new products for the purpose of better security."
