(Furthermore, the user account that controls the web application service is granted full access to run any system commands with elevated privilege, without the need for password authentication. Should vulnerabilities be identified and exploited within the web application, it may be possible for a threat actor to create or run high-privileged binaries or executables that are available within the operating system of the device.)"
