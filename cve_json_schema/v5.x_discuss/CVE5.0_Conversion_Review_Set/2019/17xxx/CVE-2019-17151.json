User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must be within a chat session together with the attacker. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of a users profile. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate a users name. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-9302."
