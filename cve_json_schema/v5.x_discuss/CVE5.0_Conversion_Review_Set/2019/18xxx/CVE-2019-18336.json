Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Profinet) could cause the affected device to go into defect mode. A restart is required in order to recover the system. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp, with no authentication. No user interation is required. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
