The vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length value in the JPEG processing module. Crafted input with an unexpected JPEG file segment size causes a mismatch between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution."
