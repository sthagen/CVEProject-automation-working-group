Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within heapdumps.jsp. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to download heap memory dump. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to disclose sensitive information in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4718."
