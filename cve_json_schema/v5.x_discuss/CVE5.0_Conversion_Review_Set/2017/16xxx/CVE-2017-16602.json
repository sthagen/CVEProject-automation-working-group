Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.tools.exec_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the command parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5193."
