The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted requests to the CAF web interface. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable.
