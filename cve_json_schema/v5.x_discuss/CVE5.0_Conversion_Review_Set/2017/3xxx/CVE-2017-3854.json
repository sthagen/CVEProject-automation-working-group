The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of the parent access point in a mesh configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forcing the target system to disconnect from the correct parent access point and reconnect to a rogue access point owned by the attacker. An exploit could allow the attacker to control the traffic flowing through the impacted access point or take full control of the target system. This vulnerability affects the following products running a vulnerable version of Wireless LAN Controller software and configured for meshed mode: Cisco 8500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco 5500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco 2500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco Flex 7500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco Virtual Wireless Controller, Wireless Services Module 2 (WiSM2). Note that additional configuration is needed in addition to upgrading to a fixed release. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuc98992 CSCuu14804."
