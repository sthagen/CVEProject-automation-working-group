Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Solaris executes to compromise Solaris. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Solaris, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
