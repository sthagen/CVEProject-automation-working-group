The device provides a user with the capability of executing various actions on the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any Origin header check which allows an attacker who can trick a user to navigate to an attacker's webpage to exploit this issue and brute force the password for the web management interface. It also allows an attacker to then execute any other actions which include management if rules, sensors attached to the devices using the websocket requests."
