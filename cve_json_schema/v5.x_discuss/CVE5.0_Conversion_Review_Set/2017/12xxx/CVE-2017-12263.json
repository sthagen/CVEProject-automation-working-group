The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. An exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd83577."
