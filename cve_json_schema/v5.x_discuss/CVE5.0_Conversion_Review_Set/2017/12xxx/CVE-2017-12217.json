The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of GPRS Tunneling Protocol packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed GPRS Tunneling Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the GTPUMGR process on an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a partial DoS condition. If the GTPUMGR process restarts, there could be a brief impact on traffic passing through the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve07119."
