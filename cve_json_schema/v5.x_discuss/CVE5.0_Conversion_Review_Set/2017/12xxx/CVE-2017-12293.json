The vulnerability is due to insufficient limitations on the number of connections that can be made to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening multiple connections to the server and exhausting server resources. A successful exploit could cause the server to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf41006."
