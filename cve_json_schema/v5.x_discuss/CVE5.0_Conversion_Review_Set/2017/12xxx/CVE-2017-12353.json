The vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed MIME header in an email attachment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a crafted MIME attachment. For example, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured user filters to drop the email. The malformed MIME headers may not be RFC compliant. However, some mail clients could still allow users to access the attachment, which may not have been properly filtered by the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf44666."
