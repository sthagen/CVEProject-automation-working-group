The vulnerability is due to the inability to handle many large IP fragments for reassembly in a short duration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of IP fragments to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the device unexpectedly reloads. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve82586."
