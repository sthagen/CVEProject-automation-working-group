An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the docker API. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data which can allow for the upload of arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-3853."
