The vulnerability is due to incomplete DNS packet header validation when the packet is received by the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DNS packet to the application. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DNS process to restart, which could lead to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Network Registrar on all software versions prior to 8.3.5. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb55412."
