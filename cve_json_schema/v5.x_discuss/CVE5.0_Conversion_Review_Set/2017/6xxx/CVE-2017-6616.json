The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize specific values that are received as part of a user-supplied HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14578."
