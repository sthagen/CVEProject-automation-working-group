The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the web-based GUI on an affected system to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web-based GUI on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14587."
