A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web server access log page of the affected devices that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via specially crafted GET requests. The code could be potentially executed later by another (privileged) user. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of other users' web sessions."
