Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Transportation Management. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Transportation Management, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Transportation Management accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Transportation Management accessible data.
