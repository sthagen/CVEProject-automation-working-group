Supported versions that are affected are 7.3.28 and prior, 7.4.27 and prior, 7.5.17 and prior, 7.6.13 and prior and 8.0.19 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Cluster. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Cluster as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Cluster accessible data.
