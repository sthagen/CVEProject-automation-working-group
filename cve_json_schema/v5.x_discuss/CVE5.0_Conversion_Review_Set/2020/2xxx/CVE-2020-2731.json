Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having Local Logon privilege with logon to the infrastructure where Core RDBMS executes to compromise Core RDBMS. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Core RDBMS accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Core RDBMS.
