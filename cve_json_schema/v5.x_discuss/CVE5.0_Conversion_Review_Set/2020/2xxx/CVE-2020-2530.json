Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.1.9.0, 12.1.3.0.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle HTTP Server. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle HTTP Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle HTTP Server accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle HTTP Server accessible data.
