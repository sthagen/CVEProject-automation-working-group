Supported versions that are affected are 15.1, 15.2, 16.1, 16.2, 17.1-17.12 and 18.1-18.8. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Primavera Unifier. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Primavera Unifier, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Primavera Unifier accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Primavera Unifier accessible data.
