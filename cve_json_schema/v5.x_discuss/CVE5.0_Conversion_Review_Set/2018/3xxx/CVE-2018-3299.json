Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Text. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Text, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Text as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Text accessible data.
