This vulnerability could be used to force a logged-in administrator to perform a silent password update. The affected forms are also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. This flaw could be triggered by driving an administrator logged into the Eaton application to a specially crafted web page. This attack could be done silently."
