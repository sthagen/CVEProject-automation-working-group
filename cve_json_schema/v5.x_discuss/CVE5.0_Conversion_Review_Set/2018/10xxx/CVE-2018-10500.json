An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of push messages. The issue lies in the ability to start an activity with controlled arguments. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application.
