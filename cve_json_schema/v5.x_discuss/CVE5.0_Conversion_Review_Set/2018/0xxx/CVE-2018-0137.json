The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting protection for TCP listening ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of TCP SYN packets to the local IP address of the targeted application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to consume a high amount of memory and become slow, or to stop accepting new TCP connections to the application.
