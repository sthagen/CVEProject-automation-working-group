The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, static user credentials for the root account. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh02680."
