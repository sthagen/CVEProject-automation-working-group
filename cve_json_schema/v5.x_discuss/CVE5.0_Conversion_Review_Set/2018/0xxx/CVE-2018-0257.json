The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain DHCP packets to a specific segment of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU usage on the affected device and cause a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg73687."
