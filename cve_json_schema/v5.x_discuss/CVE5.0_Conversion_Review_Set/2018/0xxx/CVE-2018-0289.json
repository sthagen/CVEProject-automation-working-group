The vulnerability is due to improper validation of requests stored in logs in the application management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the targeted system. An exploit could allow the attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks when an administrator views the log files. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh11308."
