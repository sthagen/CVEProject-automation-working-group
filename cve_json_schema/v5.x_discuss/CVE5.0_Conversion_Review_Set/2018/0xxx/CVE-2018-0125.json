                "value": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN and RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system, including issuing commands with root privileges. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete input validation on user-controlled input in an HTTP request to the targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and gain full control of the affected system or cause it to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.11 for the following Cisco products: RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Router and RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Router. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg92737, CSCvh60170."
