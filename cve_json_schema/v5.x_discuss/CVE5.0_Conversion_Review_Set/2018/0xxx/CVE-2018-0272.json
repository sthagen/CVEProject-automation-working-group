The vulnerability is due to improper error handling while processing SSL traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large volume of crafted SSL traffic to the vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to degrade the device performance by triggering a persistent high CPU utilization condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh89340."
