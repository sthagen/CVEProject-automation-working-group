The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of web request parameters. An attacker who has access to the web management interface of the affected application could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious web request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh99631."
