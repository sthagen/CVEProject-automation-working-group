The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) TCP connection setup for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort detection engine on the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg99327."
