The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the CLI parser subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by exceeding the expected length of user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
