The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is passed to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected software to access a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information on the affected system or perform arbitrary actions in the affected software in the security context of the user.
