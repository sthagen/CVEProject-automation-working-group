A vulnerability has been discovered in the rar.xmd parser that results from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. Paired with other vulnerabilities, this can result in denial-of-service. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
