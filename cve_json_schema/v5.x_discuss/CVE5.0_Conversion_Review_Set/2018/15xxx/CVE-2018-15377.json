The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending invalid data to the Cisco Network Plug and Play agent on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the affected device, which could cause the device to reload."
