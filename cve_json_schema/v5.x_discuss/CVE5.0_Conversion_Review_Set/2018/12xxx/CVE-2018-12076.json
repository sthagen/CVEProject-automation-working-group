The vulnerability is due to lack of proper validation of the UPC bar code present on the MarketCard. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a copy of a customer's bar code. An exploit could allow the attacker to access all funds located within the MarketCard or allow unauthenticated disclosure of information."
