An authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface (443/tcp), could execute arbitrary operating system commands. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the web interface. The attacker must be authenticated as administrative user to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
