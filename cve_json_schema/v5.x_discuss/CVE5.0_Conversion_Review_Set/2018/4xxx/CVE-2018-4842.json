X408 and SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V4.1.3). A remote, authenticated attacker with access to the configuration web server could be able to store script code on the web site, if the HRP redundancy option is set. This code could be executed in the web browser of victims visiting this web site (XSS), affecting its confidentiality, integrity and availability. User interaction is required for successful exploitation, as the user needs to visit the manipulated web site. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known. The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve it."
