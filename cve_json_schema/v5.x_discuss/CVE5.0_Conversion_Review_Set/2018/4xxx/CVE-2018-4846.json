A factory account with hardcoded password might allow attackers access to the device over port 5900/tcp. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction or privileges and impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device. At the time of advisory publication, no public exploitation of this security vulnerability is known. Siemens Healthineers confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue."
